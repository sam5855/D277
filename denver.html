                        <p>Denver is in the western United States, in the South Platte River Valley on the western edge
                            of the High Plains just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Its downtown
                            district is immediately east of the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River,
                            about 12 miles (19 kilometres) east of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. It is named
                            after James W. Denver, a governor of the Kansas Territory. It is nicknamed the Mile High
                            City because its official elevation is exactly one mile (5280 feet or 1609.344 meters) above
                            sea level.[a][22] The 105th meridian west of Greenwich, the longitudinal reference for the
                            Mountain Time Zone, passes directly through Denver Union Station.<br>Denver is ranked as a
                            Beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The 10-county
                            Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of 2,963,821 at
                            the 2020 United States census, making it the 19th most populous U.S. metropolitan
                            statistical area.[11] The 12-county Denver–Aurora, CO Combined Statistical Area had a
                            population of 3,623,560 at the 2020 U.S. census, making it the 17th most populous U.S.
                            primary statistical area.[11] Denver is the most populous city of the 18-county Front Range
                            Urban Corridor, an oblong urban region stretching across two states with a population of
                            5,055,344 at the 2020 U.S. census.[11] Its metropolitan area is the most populous within a
                            560-mile (900 km) radius and it is the second-most populous city in the Mountain West after
                            Phoenix, Arizona. In 2016, it was named the best place to live in the United States by U.S.
                            News & World Report.[23]
